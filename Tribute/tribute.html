        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant mathematician from India whose intuitive grasp of complex mathematical 
            concepts astonished the world. Despite having little formal training in pure mathematics, Ramanujan made 
            extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions.
            His work continues to inspire mathematicians around the globe.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Early Life and Background:</strong> Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, 
            a small town in the southern part of India. He was raised in Kumbakonam, where his father worked as a clerk and 
            his mother was a homemaker and a singer at the local temple. From an early age, Ramanujan showed a profound interest in mathematics,
            often indulging in complex calculations and number games.</p>
        <p>His mathematical prowess became evident during his school years, where he could easily solve advanced problems that baffled his
            peers and even his teachers. By the age of 16, Ramanujan had obtained a copy of G.S. Carr's book <i>"A Synopsis of Elementary 
            Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics,"</i> which contained thousands of theorems. This book greatly influenced him,
            and he began developing his theories and ideas.</p>

        <p><strong>Career and Achievements:</strong> Despite his extraordinary abilities, Ramanujan faced numerous challenges due to his lack of formal education and financial constraints. His passion for mathematics led him to neglect other subjects, resulting in his failure to secure a college degree. Nevertheless, Ramanujan continued his mathematical pursuits independently.</p>
        <p>In 1913, Ramanujan wrote a letter to G.H. Hardy, a renowned mathematician at Cambridge University, detailing his mathematical findings. Hardy was initially skeptical but soon recognized the brilliance in Ramanujan's work. He described Ramanujan's letter as containing theorems that were "scarcely possible to believe." Impressed by Ramanujan's talent, Hardy invited him to Cambridge.</p>

        <p>In 1914, Ramanujan traveled to England to collaborate with Hardy. Their partnership was highly fruitful, resulting in numerous groundbreaking papers. Ramanujan's contributions during his time at Cambridge include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ramanujan Prime</li>
            <li>Ramanujan Theta Function</li>
            <li>Mock Theta Functions</li>
            <li>Work on Infinite Series</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Later Years and Legacy:</strong> Ramanujan's time in England was marked by both success and hardship. The cold climate, cultural differences, and his strict vegetarian diet took a toll on his health. Despite these challenges, Ramanujan's work flourished, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, one of the youngest in history to receive this honor.</p>
        <p>In 1919, Ramanujan returned to India due to his declining health. Sadly, his condition continued to worsen, and he passed away on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32. Although his life was tragically short, Ramanujan's legacy lives on. His notebooks, filled with thousands of theorems, continue to be a source of inspiration and research. Many of his results, once considered enigmatic, have been proven correct and have found applications in various branches of mathematics and science.</p>
